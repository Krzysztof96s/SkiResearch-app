# SkiResearch-app
The project I've done and I'm working on it is the search engine for ski resorts in Poland. I used Google Maps for this
JavaScript API, then application can shows the user its exact location on the map. I also created JSON
Server where data on ski resorts are stored, including their locations that are checked on the map.
The user also has at his disposal filters that show for example the most appropriate objects in terms of skill level
ski riding or the nearest resort located from the current location.
